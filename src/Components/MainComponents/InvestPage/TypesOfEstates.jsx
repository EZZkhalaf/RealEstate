It is often the most popular choice for first-time investors because it provides steady rental income and long-term property value appreciation. Demand for housing is usually consistent, making this a relatively secure investment option.",

      title: "Commercial Properties",
      desc: "Commercial real estate covers shops, offices, malls, and other spaces used for business purposes. These properties often generate higher rental yields than residential ones but may come with longer vacancy periods. They are a great option for investors looking for bigger returns and exposure to the business sector.",

      title: "Industrial Properties",
      desc: "Industrial properties include warehouses, factories, and distribution centers. With the growth of e-commerce and logistics, demand for these spaces has increased significantly. They can provide long-term leases and stable income, but often require larger initial capital compared to residential or commercial investments.",

      title: "Land & Plots",
      desc: "Investing in land and plots is ideal for those who want long-term growth potential. Raw land can be developed into residential or commercial projects in the future, depending on location and demand. While it usually doesnâ€™t provide immediate income, it can deliver high returns if the land appreciates or is developed strategically.",

By buying shares in a REIT, you indirectly invest in a portfolio of properties managed by professionals. This option is highly liquid and suitable for investors who prefer lower barriers to entry and less management responsibility.",
